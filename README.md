# AI Chatbot for Mental Health and Stress Relief

This is a Streamlit-based chatbot application designed to provide support for mental health and stress relief. The chatbot uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries.

## Features
- A friendly and interactive chatbot interface.
- Ability to process and respond to user inputs based on intents.
- Built using NLTK for NLP, Keras for the neural network model, and TensorFlow as the backend.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- NLTK
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Keras

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK resources: Open a Python shell and run:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
Ensure the following files are present in your project directory:

intents.json: Contains the chatbot intents and responses.
words.pkl and classes.pkl: Pre-processed data for the chatbot.
uit_chat.h5: Pre-trained neural network model.
Running the Application
Start the chatbot using Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
How to Use
Enter your query in the text input box.
The chatbot will analyze your message and respond accordingly.
If the chatbot cannot understand your message, try rephrasing it.
